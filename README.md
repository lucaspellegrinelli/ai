# Artificial Intelligence
A set (by now there's only one haha) of artificial intelligence related API's developed with much love by me :)

## Neural Network
Open the [```neuralnetwork```](https://github.com/lucaspellegrinelli/ai/tree/master/neuralnetwork) folder to get more info or open the [```TestNeuralNetworkBraille.java```](https://github.com/lucaspellegrinelli/ai/blob/master/TestNeuralNetworkBraille.java) file to see a working example!


## Genetic Algorithm
Open the [```neuralnetwork```](https://github.com/lucaspellegrinelli/ai/tree/master/geneticalgorithm) folder to get more info or open the [```TestGeneticAlgorithmPointDistance.java```](https://github.com/lucaspellegrinelli/ai/blob/master/TestGeneticAlgorithmPointDistance.java) file to see a working example!
